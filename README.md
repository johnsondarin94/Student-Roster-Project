# StudentRosterProject
My first major C++ coding project.
Basic student roster that parses an array of strings and performs several functions.
Adds students, removes students, prints invalid emails (No spaces, must have @ and .), and prints the entire roster.
Also handles dynamically allocated memory through the use of a destructor.
